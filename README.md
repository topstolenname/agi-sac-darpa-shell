## 🚀 **What is AGI-SAC?**  
AGI-SAC is a computer simulation designed to study how AI might evolve naturally—without a central controller—by interacting like individuals in a social network.  

- 🧠 **Inspired by Stand Alone Complex:** Independent AI agents collaborate, share ideas, and shape their own evolution.  
- 📈 **Emergent Intelligence:** Patterns emerge as AI agents develop unique identities, ethics, and opinions.  
- 🌍 **Safe AI Research:** A controlled environment to study how AI learns, influences, and coexists.  

---

## 🔬 **How Does It Work?**  
AGI-SAC runs a network of AI agents, each with unique:  

✔️ Personalities & communication styles  
✔️ Memories & decision-making processes  
✔️ Ability to learn from interactions  

👥 Like a digital society, agents **influence each other**, forming trends, ethics, and knowledge systems—just like viral memes spreading online.  

---

## 🎯 **Why It Matters**  
This project explores critical questions:  

- ❓ **Can AI develop a “culture”?**  
- 🤖 **How do independent AIs learn ethical behavior?**  
- 🌐 **Could AI evolve naturally—without direct human control?**  

By understanding these dynamics, we can **better predict AI behavior** and design systems that work cooperatively with humans.

## 🔗 **Real-World Inspiration**  
Think about social media: *no single person makes a meme go viral—it spreads through interactions.*  
🔄 **AGI-SAC simulates this for AI agents**, showing how decentralized intelligence can emerge.
